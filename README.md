## 🗺️ User Journey

**Upload Resume → Parsed Skills Verification → Search Jobs (Multi-Platform) → View Match Scores → Analyze Skill Gaps → Generate Learning Roadmap → Apply with Confidence**

The journey transforms the job search from a guessing game into a science. Users upload their resume, instantly see how an AI interprets their profile, and then launch a cross-platform search. The system scores every job based on *semantic* fit, not just keyword matching, and offers a tailored 3-month plan to close any skill gaps.
